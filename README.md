## General Information
- For a financial company, customer complaints carry a lot of importance, as they are often an indicator of the shortcomings in their products and services. If these complaints are resolved efficiently in time, they can bring down customer dissatisfaction to a minimum and retain them with stronger loyalty. This also gives them an idea of how to continuously improve their services to attract more customers. 
- These customer complaints are unstructured text data; so, traditionally, companies need to allocate the task of evaluating and assigning each ticket to the relevant department to multiple support employees. This becomes tedious as the company grows and has a large customer base.
- created a model that can automatically classify customer complaints based on the products and services that the ticket mentions.
- Following are the five clusters based on the product/service:
		1.Bank account services
		2.Credit card / Prepaid card
		3.Mortgages/loans
		4.Theft/Dispute reporting
		5.Others
